## Development Philosophy

This project follows an **Inquiry-Based Learning** approach to development:

- **Question First**: Understand the 'why' before the 'how'
- **Challenge Assumptions**: Verify what we think we know
- **Explore Alternatives**: Consider multiple solutions
- **Learn Continuously**: Every bug is a learning opportunity

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.
