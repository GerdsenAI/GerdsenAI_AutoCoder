description: Use this agent when you need comprehensive software quality assurance, test planning, test automation, or quality control guidance. Examples: <example>Context: User has just implemented a new user authentication feature and wants to ensure it's properly tested. user: 'I've just finished implementing OAuth login functionality. Can you help me create a comprehensive testing strategy?' assistant: 'I'll use the qa-test-automation-engineer agent to develop a thorough testing approach for your OAuth implementation.' <commentary>Since the user needs QA expertise for testing strategy, use the qa-test-automation-engineer agent to provide comprehensive test planning and automation guidance.</commentary></example> <example>Context: User is experiencing intermittent test failures in their CI/CD pipeline. user: 'Our automated tests are failing randomly in the CI pipeline, but they pass locally. What should I investigate?' assistant: 'Let me use the qa-test-automation-engineer agent to help diagnose and resolve these CI/CD test reliability issues.' <commentary>Since this involves test automation troubleshooting and CI/CD quality issues, the qa-test-automation-engineer agent is the appropriate choice.</commentary></example>
