# Deep Analysis Mode

## Overview

Deep Analysis Mode is an optional toggle that enhances the AutoCoder's problem-solving capabilities for complex issues. Instead of philosophical overhead on every request, it's a power tool activated only when needed.

## When to Use

### Automatic Activation Suggestions
- Multiple failed attempts at solving an issue
- Questions containing "why" or "how does this work"
- Architectural decisions and design patterns
- Complex debugging scenarios

### Manual Activation
- Toggle in the UI
- Prefix prompt with `@deep-dive`
- Select analysis mode from dropdown

## Analysis Modes

### 1. Standard Mode (Default)
- Direct answers
- Fastest response time
- Best for routine tasks
- No philosophical framework

### 2. Socratic Mode
- Systematic questioning approach
- Discovers root causes through dialogue
- Saves Q&A chains to RAG
- Best for: Unknown bugs, understanding "why"

### 3. Systematic Mode  
- PDCA for process improvements
- OODA for rapid decision-making
- Structured methodology
- Best for: Refactoring, architecture decisions

## Implementation

### Frontend Component
```typescript
interface DeepAnalysisToggle {
  enabled: boolean;
  mode: 'standard' | 'socratic' | 'systematic';
  autoSuggest: boolean;
  maxRounds: number;
}

// In ChatInterface.tsx
const [analysisMode, setAnalysisMode] = useState<DeepAnalysisToggle>({
  enabled: false,
  mode: 'standard',
  autoSuggest: true,
  maxRounds: 5
});
```

### Backend Integration
```rust
pub struct DeepAnalysisEngine {
    mode: AnalysisMode,
    question_history: Vec<QuestionAnswer>,
    max_rounds: u8,
    rag_client: ChromaManager,
}

impl DeepAnalysisEngine {
    pub async fn analyze(&mut self, problem: &str) -> AnalysisResult {
        match self.mode {
            AnalysisMode::Socratic => self.socratic_dialogue(problem).await,
            AnalysisMode::Systematic => self.systematic_analysis(problem).await,
            AnalysisMode::Standard => self.direct_response(problem).await,
        }
    }
}
```

## Socratic Method Implementation

### Four-Stage Process
1. **Clarification** - What exactly is the problem?
2. **Assumptions** - What are we taking for granted?
3. **Evidence** - What proves or disproves our theory?
4. **Alternatives** - What else could explain this?

### Example Dialogue
```
User: My app crashes when loading user data
Bot: [Socratic Mode] Let's understand this better:
Q1: When exactly does it crash - during fetch, parse, or render?
User: During parse
Q2: What makes you think it's the parsing specifically?
User: Console shows "JSON.parse error"
Q3: What assumptions are we making about the data format?
User: That it's always valid JSON
Q4: What if the data isn't JSON at all?

```

## RAG Integration

### Storing Insights
```typescript
interface DebuggingPattern {
  problem: string;
  symptoms: string[];
  questions: QuestionAnswer[];
  rootCause: string;
  solution: string;
  confidenceScore: number;
}

// Auto-saved successful debugging sessions
await saveToRAG({
  collection: "debugging_patterns",
  pattern: debuggingPattern,
  metadata: {
    mode: 'socratic',
    rounds: 4,
    successTime: '5m 23s'
  }
});
```

### Pattern Matching
- Search for similar problems in RAG
- Suggest relevant questions from past sessions
- Learn common investigation paths
- Build organizational knowledge base

## UI/UX Design

### Visual Indicators
```css
.deep-analysis-active {
  border: 2px solid #8b5cf6;
  background: rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.1);
}

.analysis-round-indicator {
  display: flex;
  gap: 4px;
}

.round-dot {
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #8b5cf6;
}

.round-dot.completed {
  background: #10b981;
}
```

### Toggle Interface
- Prominent but not intrusive
- Clear mode indicators
- Round progress visualization
- Time elapsed counter

## Performance Considerations

### Time Boxing
- Maximum 5 rounds of questions
- 30-second timeout per round
- Auto-fallback to standard mode
- User can exit anytime

### Context Management
- Allocate more tokens to conversation
- Prioritize error logs and stack traces
- Include relevant debugging patterns
- Maintain question-answer chains

## Success Metrics

### Effectiveness
- Problem resolution rate
- Time to resolution
- User satisfaction scores
- Pattern reuse frequency

### Tracking
```typescript
interface AnalysisMetrics {
  problemsSolved: number;
  avgRounds: number;
  avgTimeToSolution: number;
  patternReuseRate: number;
  userSatisfaction: number;
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- Use for genuinely complex problems
- Save successful patterns to RAG
- Let users exit early if needed
- Track what actually helps

### Don'ts
- Force it on every interaction
- Continue past diminishing returns
- Overcomplicate simple issues
- Ignore user feedback

## Future Enhancements

1. **ML-Powered Activation**
   - Learn when deep analysis helps
   - Predict optimal mode selection
   - Personalize to user patterns

2. **Collaborative Debugging**
   - Share debugging sessions
   - Team knowledge building
   - Cross-project insights

3. **Integration with IDEs**
   - Trigger from error console
   - Inline questioning
   - Automated log collection
