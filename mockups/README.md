## Context Window Visualizer

**File**: `context-window-visualizer.html`

An interactive prototype demonstrating the improved context window management interface.

### Features Demonstrated:
- **Token Budget Bar**: Visual representation of context allocation
- **File Management**: Pin/unpin files, see relevance scores

- **Control Panel**: Model selection and strategy presets

### Usage:
1. Open `context-window-visualizer.html` in a web browser
2. Interact with the various controls to see the UI behavior
3. Use as reference for implementing the actual React components

### Implementation Notes:
- Color scheme matches the main application's dark theme
- All interactions are client-side JavaScript for easy prototyping
- Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
- Focus on clarity and user control over AI decisions

This mockup represents the pragmatic approach to context window management, prioritizing user understanding and control over technical complexity.
